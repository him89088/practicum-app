                        <b>Who is conducting this research?</b> <br>
                            This postgraduate dissertation research project is being
                            conducted by Himanshu Vashisht & Alekhya
                            Nethra, under the supervision of Prof. Tomas Ward, School of Computing, DCU, and Lili Zhang, School of Computing, DCU,
                            in collaboration with Dr. Brian Slattery, School of Psychology, DCU.<br><br>
                        <b>Title of the research</b> <br>Modelling the Effects of Chronic Pain on Human Decision Making by using a Reinforcement Learning
                        Model <br><br>
                        <b>What is the research about?</b> <br>This research will use a web application, where participants living with chronic pain 
                        will complete a series of computer games that involve decision making responses. <br><br>
                        <b>What is the aim of the research?</b><br> People make decisions all the time. Living with chronic pain 
                        or experiencing pain can impact how we make those decisions. For example, depending on your pain level, your decision making
                        ability might be affected, even to the point of not being able to make a decision. The aim of this research is to
                        investigate the patterns in decision making for people living with chronic pain.  <br><br>

                        <b>What will happen if I decide to participate in this research study?</b> 
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                If you are interested in participating in the study, you will be provided with a unique user ID
                                and a link to the study (which can be accessed via your computer or mobile phone), and you
                                will be asked to read and complete a Consent Form to indicate that you understand what your
                                participation involves.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After completing the Consent Form, you will be asked a few questions about your age,
                                gender and experience of pain.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then you will complete a series of short computer games that investigate decision making.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The study will take no longer than 30 minutes.
                            </li>
                        </ol><br>
                        <b>What happens if I change my mind?</b> <br>Participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw your participation from the study for
                        any reason, without penalty, at any point prior to the submission of your data.<br><br>

                        <b>How will my privacy be protected?</b><br> Due to the anonymity of the study and the fact that the computer games are completed anonymously,
                        no identifying personal information will be collected. So your privacy and confidentiality will be
                        maintained at all times.<br>
                        We <b>do not</b> ask for your:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Name</li>
                            <li>E-Mail</li>
                            <li>Phone Number</li>
                        </ul>
                        We <b>do</b> ask for your:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gender</li>
                            <li>Age</li>
                            <li>Duration of you experiencing pain</li>
                            <li>Brief history of pain levels and pain interfering with day-to-day life (on a scale of 0-10, 0 being lowest and 10 being
                                highest)</li>
                        </ul><br>

                        <b>How will the data be used and subsequently disposed of?</b> <br>
                        Your name will not be included at any stage of this research. All data gathered will be analysed using
                        a Bayesian reinforcement learning model on a password protected computer belonging to the student
                        researchers. Data will only be accessible to the student researchers, research supervisors, and, upon
                        request, data may also be accessed by an external examiner. If the study is not published, the data
                        will be held for a period of one year after the completion of the thesis. If the study is published, the
                        data will be held for a period of five years after the completion of the thesis. After this time, all data will
                        be shredded and/or be disposed by the research supervisor.<br><br>

                        <b>What are the legal limitations to data confidentiality?</b> <br>
                            Confidentiality of information can only be provided within the limits of the law. It is possible for data to
                            be subject to freedom of information request and statute in relation to GDPR. However, given the
                            nature of the study, and that you have anonymity, such requests are not anticipated.<br><br>

                        <b>What are the benefits of participating in the study?</b> <br>
                        While there are no direct benefits to participants from this research, it is envisaged that some
                        participants may enjoy participating in research, exploring a novel method of recording their pain
                        experiences and indeed their indirect contribution to our scientific understanding of chronic pain, how
                        pain can be managed and even reduced.<br><br>

                        <b>What are the risks of participating in the study?</b> <br>
                        Given the nature of the research project and the data collection methods employed, the risk level of
                        this study is considered to be very low. In the unlikely event that you may experience some discomfort
                        or stress while reporting pain related experiences, pain interference levels and social support, please
                        contact your GP or Samaritans Ireland (01 872 7700, jo@samaritans.ie), regardless of whether you
                        submitted any data. <span  style="color:#3399ff">If you are a DCU students, the student counselling services 
                            (01 7005165, counselling@dcu.ie) is also available.</span> Also, please remember, that you can withdraw from the study
                        at any point prior to the submission of your data.<br><br>

                        As this study is part of the student researcherâ€™s MSc dissertation, individual feedback will not be
                        provided to participants. However, participants can email the student researcher from the contacts below and
                        request a summary of the research findings.<br><br>
